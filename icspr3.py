# --- REQUIRED PYTHON LIBRARIES (INSTALL WITH pip) ---
# ‚úÖ No external libraries are required.
# ‚úÖ This implementation uses only built-in Python functions.
# ‚úÖ The random module is used to generate random private keys.

# --- SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT ---
# Sample Output when run:
# Publicly shared values:
# Prime number (p): 23
# Primitive root (g): 5
# Alice's private key (a): 4
# Bob's private key (b): 3
# Alice's public key (A): 4
# Bob's public key (B): 10
# Alice's computed shared secret: 13
# Bob's computed shared secret: 13
# ‚úÖ Success! Shared secret key established: 13

# --- SHORT WORKING OF PROGRAM ---
# 1. Public values:
#    - A prime number (p) and a primitive root modulo p (g) are agreed upon by Alice and Bob.
#    - These are public and known to both parties.
#
# 2. Private keys:
#    - Alice and Bob each select their private keys (a and b).
#    - These are secret and kept private.
#
# 3. Public keys:
#    - Alice computes her public key (A) as A = g^a mod p and sends it to Bob.
#    - Bob computes his public key (B) as B = g^b mod p and sends it to Alice.
#
# 4. Shared secret:
#    - Alice computes the shared secret using Bob's public key: shared_secret_alice = B^a mod p.
#    - Bob computes the shared secret using Alice's public key: shared_secret_bob = A^b mod p.
#    - Both Alice and Bob arrive at the same shared secret, ensuring secure communication.
#
# 5. Verification:
#    - Both Alice and Bob verify that their computed shared secrets match.
#    - If they match, the key exchange is successful, and they can use the shared secret for encryption.
#    - If not, there is an error in the process (although it should not happen).

# --- BITWISE CALCULATIONS USED ---
# ‚úî Modular exponentiation: 
#    - Alice and Bob compute their public keys using: 
#      A = g^a mod p, B = g^b mod p.
#    - The shared secret is calculated using: shared_secret = (other party's public key) ^ private key mod p.
# ‚úî Random private key: Each party selects a random private key between 1 and p-2.
#
# Example:
#    - p = 23, g = 5
#    - Alice's private key a = 4 ‚Üí Alice's public key A = 5^4 mod 23 = 625 mod 23 = 4
#    - Bob's private key b = 3 ‚Üí Bob's public key B = 5^3 mod 23 = 125 mod 23 = 10
#
# Shared secret:
#    - Alice calculates shared_secret = 10^4 mod 23 = 10000 mod 23 = 13
#    - Bob calculates shared_secret = 4^3 mod 23 = 64 mod 23 = 13
#    - Both Alice and Bob obtain the same shared secret: 13

# --- NOTES ---
# üîê This implementation demonstrates the **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** algorithm.
# üîê It allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
# üîê The strength of the Diffie-Hellman protocol relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in modular arithmetic.
